Created an Android app called MealMate using Kotlin in Android Studio. 
Designed to help Hera (a busy friend) decide what to eat based on the time of day. 
App uses simple if statements to match times of day with meal suggestions. 
No arrays used – logic kept simple and easy to follow. 

Purpose of the App: 
Simplify daily meal decisions for busy users. 
Offer quick suggestions based on user input (time of day). 
Make meal planning fun and efficient. 
Practice clean coding, version control, and automation tools. 

App Features:
